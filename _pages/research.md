### Why Federal Incumbents Avoid Blame in Disaster Management: The Role of Integrated Party Systems in Federal COVID-19 Policies

    This article examines how intra-party relations influence federal government policy strategies during crisis management, focusing on COVID-19 pre-vaccine policies. The main argument is that federal involvement in state-level policy-making depends on electoral risk calculations. When avoiding blame is more costly than taking responsibility, federal authorities are more likely to collaborate on public health measures. Conversely, if avoiding blame is less costly, they may refrain from state-level intervention. Integrated parties and party systems play a crucial role in these calculations, linking regional elites to federal incumbents' political futures. Consequently, federal incumbents consider state politicians' policy preferences, encouraging them to assume more responsibilities.

    To test these arguments, I analyze data from 16 constitutional federal countries, using a novel dataset on government-specific Protective Policy Indices (PPI) from the Binghamton University COVID-19 Policy Response lab. The findings reveal that the integratedness of sub-national party systems with national systems affects federal decision-making throughout the pre-vaccine period.
