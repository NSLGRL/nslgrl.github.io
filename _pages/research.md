# WHY FEDERAL INCUMBENTS' AVOID BLAMES IN THE DISASTER MANAGEMENT PROCESS: THE ROLE OF INTEGRATED PARTY SYSTEMS IN THE FEDERAL COUNTRIES' COVID-19 POLICIES
## Abstract: 
This article delves into the influence of intra-party relations on the policy strategies of federal governments during crisis management with a focus on the pre-vaccine period of COVID-19 policies. The main argument of this research is that federal governments' involvement in state-level policy-making during the COVID-19 pandemic depends on their electoral risk calculations. When federal authorities perceive that avoiding blame will result in higher costs than taking more responsibilities, they are more willing to collaborate on implementing precautionary public health measures. On the contrary, if they believe staying idle and avoiding blame is less costly, they may choose not to intervene in the state-level policy-making process. Integrated parties and party systems are crucial in federal authorities' risk calculation processes. As integrated party ties link regional elites to the political future of federal incumbents, the federal incumbents consider the electoral outcomes of state politicians' policy preferences, encouraging them to take on more responsibilities.
To examine these arguments, I analyze data from 16 constitutional federal countries, which I collected and curated as part of a novel data set on government-specific Protective Policy Indices (PPI) from the Binghamton University COVID-19 Policy Response lab. The evidence reveals that the level of integratedness of sub-national party systems with the national party system influences federal authorities' decisions across jurisdictions throughout the pre-vaccine period.\\
