<details>
<summary>Abstract</summary>
<p>This paper analyzes intergovernmental task sharing in combating the COVID-19 pandemic by focusing on the practices of the two largest African countries—Nigeria and South Africa. Nigeria is a constitutional federation; South Africa is a unitary country where the constitution delegates some public policies to subnational governments. Whether regional and national politicians were willing to collaborate during the pandemic depended on their calculus of the benefits and costs of sharing the political risks and the blame for imposing restrictive measures across jurisdictions. In Nigeria, federal authorities preferred to avoid risks, and subnational politicians became the primary actors who implemented restrictive policies and, thus, accepted the risks and blame. In South Africa, national authorities almost entirely took over the responsibility for pandemic policies. This paper argues that the partisan elite linkage, the saliency of federal politics at the subnational level, and the constitutional design framing the nexus of the regional- and national-level politics all mattered by creating distinctive incentives for politicians to take restrictive pandemic measures.</p>

<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-022-01437-9" target="_blank">Protective Policy Index (PPI) global dataset of origins and stringency of COVID 19 mitigation policies</a>

<details>
<summary>Abstract</summary>
<p>We have developed and made accessible for multidisciplinary audiences a unique global dataset of the behavior of political actors during the COVID-19 pandemic as measured by their policy-making efforts to protect the public. The dataset presents consistently coded cross-national data at subnational and national levels on the daily level of stringency of public health policies by level of government overall and within specific policy categories and reports branches of government that adopted these policies. The data on these public mandates of protective behaviors is collected from media announcements and government publications. The dataset allows comparisons of governments’ policy efforts and timing worldwide and can provide information on policy determinants of pandemic outcomes–both societal and possibly medical.</p>

COVID-19 Pandemic in Somalia, South Africa, and Zimbabwe: Why Do Leaders Love COVID-19 Precautions? (Forthcoming)
<details>
<summary>Abstract</summary>
<p>The COVID-19 pandemic brought unprecedented challenges, prompting policymakers
to navigate complex trade-offs between safeguarding public health
and upholding civil liberties. This chapter examines how political systems influenced
policy responses during the pandemic, focusing on South Africa, Somalia,
and Zimbabwe. Drawing on existing literature and empirical data, we explore
the impact of political constraints on COVID-19 policy outcomes, comparing
the effectiveness of measures implemented in democratic and authoritarian
contexts. Our analysis reveals distinct patterns: while South Africa exhibited
stricter precautions, political dynamics in Somalia and Zimbabwe allowed for
more aggressive measures despite lower policy effectiveness. We attribute these
variations to differences in political accountability, media freedom, and judicial
independence. Our findings highlight the critical role of political constraints in </p>
