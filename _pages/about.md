I am a PhD candidate in the Political Science Department at SUNY Binghamton. My research interests revolve around fiscal federalism, intergovernmental relations, crisis management, and party systems. Specifically, I examine the impact of party systems on the vertical policy coordination between federal and state units at the local level during the COVID-19 pandemic. 
My dissertation theoretically lies on second-generation fiscal federalism, claiming that elected policy-makers set their policy strategies depending on their electoral concerns rather than acting by altruistic instincts. It investigates how party systems at the sub-national level encourage elected policy-makers to share policy risks rather than shifting the blame. The main argument of this project is that as the party system becomes integrated, their projections on protecting or empowering their electoral position are embedded in each other, by which they are eager to coordinate their policy strategies to minimize the risk of policy failure. 
For this purpose, I utilized a novel dataset created by [Binghamton University COVID Lab](https://www.openicpsr.org/openicpsr/project/123401/version/V6/view?path=/openicpsr/123401/fcr:versions/V6/data/PPI_country_m1.csv&type=file), producing Public Health Protective Policy Index across 82 countries in 15 policy categories for national and sub-national units.
