This course introduces techniques for collecting, analyzing, and utilizing extensive data for social science inferences. The ultimate goal of this class is to improve studentsâ€™ statistical and programming skills. For this purpose, we will cover recent developments in machine learning techniques and their implementation in political science and public policy. 
We will use R, an open-source statistical computing environment. Since this course will introduce the basics of R programming, no prior exposure to the statistical programming language is required. Additionally, this class will provide an overview of summarizing, visualizing, and creating reproducible documents in R. Then, students in this course will learn the basics of supervised and unsupervised learning techniques and their empirical implementations in political research.
