This seminar introduces students to the theoretical framework of new institutionalism, focusing on rational choice institutionalism, historical institutionalism, and sociological institutionalism. We will review key literature on institutional design, stability, change, and the social and political consequences of institutions. The course aims to familiarize students with essential texts and recent publications in these areas and to help them incorporate insights from the readings into their own research.
