This seminar introduces students to the theoretical framework of new institutionalism. It will explore the three primary strands of theory: rational choice institutionalism, historical institutionalism, and sociological institutionalism. Additionally, it will delve into contemporary literature on institutional design, stability and change, and institutions' social and political consequences. In this context, the course has two main objectives: first, to familiarize students with the essentials of institutional analysis, and second, to assist students in understanding economic and political issues from the institutional perspective.
